# Lesson 6

## Introducing Sinatra

I'd planned on giving the lesson outlined for Lesson 7 here. But IT problems
meant we couldn't run Sinatra on the class PCs. Instead, I gave an overview of
Sinatra, and then we developed a console based version of the Dice
application.

* Show Hello World code. (Explain a little about RubyGems.)
* Demo Hello World. (Explain how to start/stop the server. Restart after changes.)
* Explain browser requests.
* Explain response.
* Explain why we use a framework.

* Introduce the rand() method.
* Exercise: Write a console app that simulates two dice being rolled.
