    <h1>Ruby</h1>


    <p><a href="ruby.html">Ruby</a> is a dynamic, reflective, general purpose object-oriented programming language that combines syntax inspired by Perl with Smalltalk-like features. Ruby originated in Japan during the mid-1990s and was initially developed and designed by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto. It was influenced primarily by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, and Lisp.</p>

    <p>Ruby supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional, object oriented, imperative and reflective. It also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management; it is therefore similar in varying respects to Python, Perl, Lisp, Dylan, Pike, and CLU.</p>

    <h2 id="history">History</h2>

    <p>Ruby was conceived on February 24, 1993 by Yukihiro Matsumoto who wished to create a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming. Matsumoto has stated, "I wanted a scripting language that was more powerful than Perl, and more object-oriented than Python. That's why I decided to design my own language".</p>

    <h2>Philosophy</h2>

    <p>Matsumoto has said that Ruby is <em>designed for programmer productivity and fun</em>, following the principles of good user interface design. He stresses that systems design needs to emphasize human, rather than computer, needs:</p>

    <blockquote><p>Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. They think, "By doing this, the machine will run faster. By doing this, the machine will run more effectively. By doing this, the machine will something something something." They are focusing on machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines. We are the masters. They are the slaves.</p></blockquote>

    <pre><code>puts "Hello World!"</code></pre>
