Like when you meet Somebody in college and they look like somebody who used to hit you in the face with paintbrushes when you were a kid. And so, impulsively, you conclude that this new Somebody is likely a non-friend. You wince at their hair. You hang up phones loudly during crucial moments in their anecdotes. You use your pogo stick right there where they are trying to walk!

Six months later, somehow, you and Somebody are sitting at a fountain having a perfectly good chat. Their face doesn't look so much like that childhood nemesis. You've met the Good Twin. You clicked.

So whereas I should probably be pounding your teeth in with hype about Ruby and the tightly-knit cadre of pertinent ancronyms that accompany it everywhere (whetting the collective whistles of your bosses and their bosses' bosses), instead I will just let you coast. I'll let you freefall through some code, interjecting occassionally with my own heartfelt experiences. It'll be quite easy, quite natural.
